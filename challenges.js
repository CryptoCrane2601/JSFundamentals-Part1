//Coding Challenge #1
//Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
//calculated using the formula:
//BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
//and height in meter).
//Your tasks:
//1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
//2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
//versions)
//3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
//whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
//Test data:
//ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
//m tall.
//ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
//m tall.

//const markHeight = 1.69;
//const markMass = 78;

//const johnHeight = 1.95;
//const johnMass = 92;

//const bmiMark = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
//console.log(bmiMark);

//const bmiMark2 = markMass / (markHeight * markHeight);
//console.log(bmiMark2);

//const bmiJohn = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
//const bmiJohn2 = johnMass / (johnHeight * johnHeight);
//console.log(bmiJohn, bmiJohn2);

//const markHigherBMI = bmiMark > bmiJohn;
//const markHigherBMI2 = bmiMark2 > bmiJohn2;

//console.log(markHigherBMI, markHigherBMI2);

//Second data for heights and mass

//const markHeight = 1.88;
//const markMass = 95;

//const johnHeight = 1.76;
//const johnMass = 85;

//const bmiMark = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
//console.log(bmiMark);

//const bmiMark2 = markMass / (markHeight * markHeight);
//console.log(bmiMark2);

//const bmiJohn = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
//const bmiJohn2 = johnMass / (johnHeight * johnHeight);
//console.log(bmiJohn, bmiJohn2);

//const markHigherBMI = bmiMark > bmiJohn;
//const markHigherBMI2 = bmiMark2 > bmiJohn2;

//console.log(markHigherBMI, markHigherBMI2);
